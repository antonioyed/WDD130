                    With us you can live a wonderful experience in the most beautiful rivers that you can imagine with
                    beautiful waters and shores that seem like paradises, such is the case of:
                    <br> <br> Main Fork of the Salmon River, Idaho <br> <br>
                    Nestled deep in the Frank Church Wilderness of No Return winds the Salmon river. The Salmon was
                    given the nickname long ago as the River of No Return by the people living near it because of the
                    number of folks that came to visit and fell so in love with the rugged beauty of the river that they
                    never left.

                    Herds of elk and deer graze on the hillsides around the river and bear and bighorn sheep are also
                    commonly sighted. The river corridor is also lined with awe inspiring ponderosa pine which tower
                    over the sandy beaches in the campsites and provide shelter from sun or rain when needed.

                    Let's not forget the rapids! They range from class I-IV. The Salmon is one of the longest undammed
                    rivers in the United States. As a free flowing river the water is higher, faster, and colder in the
                    early summer and lower, slower, and warmer in the late summer. There are good rapids all
                    summer...but families with children who like to swim tend to appreciate the late summer's slower,
                    warmer water more. And like this there are many other wonders that will be within your reach just by
                    contacting us.

                    Near the river you choose you will always have the opportunity to find a nearby camp where you can
                    spend the night before continuing with the adventure.

                    you will have time to share experiences with the group because we will put at your disposal a night
                    campfire in which we will share and also show our experiences with those who are in the adventure so
                    that we can have new ideas for the next day. and so add those new skills learned together. We want
                    you to stay so we will put at your disposal the best of an overnight camp to turn your experience
