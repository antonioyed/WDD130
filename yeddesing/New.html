    <strong class="str">What is a Photographer?</strong>. <br> <br>

    <p class="papa"> A photographer typically works in a freelance capacity, and is hired for specific jobs by a variety
      of clients. A
      part-time/freelance photographer hired by a client is responsible for following the client's wishes down to the
      finest details, as well as for setting up a business model that makes pricing and options clearly visible and
      accessible.
      <br><br>
      Photographers are responsible for the digital or physical development of their images, and may also be responsible
      for some or all of the editing. The editing process may include simple cropping, adding/changing colors and
      shading,
      adjusting sharpness and lighting, or removing objects to clean the image up.
      <br>
      There are many genres of photography one can specialize in, such as:
      <br> <br>
      <strong> Wedding Photography</strong> <br>
      Wedding photography is a very specialized type of photography. The wedding day is typically one of the most
      important and memorable days in a person's lifetime, and one that will be remembered for years to come. Therefore,
      for most couples, regular photographs just won’t do. Professional wedding photographers are hired to capture a
      couple's irreplaceable moments by taking creative, candid, and beautiful photographs of the wedding ceremony and
      reception.
      <br><br>
      Before even photographing a wedding, the photographer corresponds with the clients for months, or even a year or
      two, before the actual wedding date. Getting to know the clients and understanding their likes, dislikes, and
      their
      ultimate vision is important, so that when the wedding day comes the couple feels comfortable enough to let their
      true personalities come out and shine. Once details are agreed upon, a standard written agreement is signed
      between
      the bride- and groom-to-be and the photographer.
      <br><br>
      After the event is over, the images are processed as quickly as possible, the wedding photographer and couple will
      meet to go over the images, and ordering details are finalized. A high level of customer service is just as
      important after the event as before it — good customer relationships can lead to family portraits and portraits of
      their children in years to come.

      <strong> Fashion Photography</strong><br>
      Fashion photographers are responsible for photographing apparel, accessories, and fashion models, as well as
      collaborating with hair stylists, fashion stylists, makeup artists, and fashion designers. A fashion photographer
      can either work freelance or be hired by a fashion designer, fashion publication, fashion house, advertising
      agency, or a fashion/beauty magazine. <br> <br>

      Through their photographs, fashion photographers are able to create a certain aura and define what beauty and
      style is. Responsibilities typically involve setting up and running photo shoots, communicating with make-up
      artists and fashion designers to best represent their vision, and editing the photographs. <br> <br>

     <strong> Real Estate Photography</strong><br>
      Real estate is a very competitive industry, filled with ambitious agents looking for their next sale. Selling real
      estate is about setting yourself apart from the competition, and one of the ways that can be done is by capturing
      beautiful and enticing photos of a home that is for sale. Real estate photographers specifically hone in on this
      area of photography, creating photos for real estate agents and their property listings on the MLS (Multiple
      Listing Service). <br> <br>

      This type of photography is somewhat detached from most of the artistic freedom one can enjoy with other forms of
      photography. Real estate photographers provide a much needed service for a very fast-paced industry. However,
      because the photos are temporary and, for the most part, don't have much sentimental value, the photographer can
      concentrate on producing a top notch product that can be duplicated from one photo shoot to the next. <br> <br>

     <strong> Travel Photography</strong><br>
      Travel photography involves taking images that express an area's people, culture, customs, landscape, and history.
      However, travel photography, unlike other types of photography such as fashion, wedding, or real estate
      photography, is harder to monetize. More and more photographers are using creative ways to earn a living such as
      stock photography, blogging, commercial projects, and teaching.<br> <br>

      Careers in travel photography can be as varied as the destinations they serve. A big part of making a career out
      of this type of photography is by tapping into social media marketing, content development, negotiation, and
      sales. However, the first step is to just get out there and take some pictures — having a good portfolio is key in
      this genre of photography.
