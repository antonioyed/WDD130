                On the apple website you can see that there is a generous contrast in the presentation of their
                equipment as a central piece in the exhibition that in this case is the iphone 14 and they place it
                with a black background to highlight it and take your eyes there since the following content is in
                lower tones since they are descriptions and other options. this gives a good view and focuses you on
                what the company wants you to see in this case is the iphone.

            <h2>Repetition</h2>
            <h3 class="h3repetition"> Real Madid Store</h3>
            <a class="lirepetition"
                href="https://shop.realmadrid.com/?awc=21965_1663979923_cd556212af1e6f5db7e2626f417c5a96&utm_source=Affiliates&utm_medium=AWIN&utm_campaign=101248">RealMadrid.com</a>

            <p class="prepetition">
                In this case, you can see the repetition of the Real Madrid logo in its header and in the players'
                shirt that is in promotion, and if you visit the site and continue scrolling down, you will see more
                logos along the page, which gives When buying the feeling of being part of the club with any item
                they want to buy, which is a great strategy for sales.

            <h2>Alignment</h2>

            <p class="prepetition">
                In the case of the church page, the alignment that exists between content and description is
                    incredible and this means that when you visit this web page you can find what you are looking for
                    and where you are looking for it because each separate description has an image that is aligned to
                    her and tells you what you will find.
