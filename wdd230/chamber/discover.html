                districts and has an economy plagued by tourism and mining that makes this city very promising and
                committed. At an industrial level, it is recognized as a center for the production of leather and
                footwear, as well as an important agribusiness hub. </p>

            <p class="ptu">93% of tourists are of national origin, 71% from Lima, and the rest from Lambayeque,
                Cajamarca, Piura, Ancash and San Mart√≠n. Foreign tourists who are interested in visiting Trujillo's
                tourist attractions have the following characteristics: 36% come from Europe, 18% from North America,
                10% from Israel, 20% from South America, 4% from Australia and 12% from other places according to the

            <p class="pop">The population of the city has been changing a lot over the decades. In the years when it was
                the capital of the Intendancy of Trujillo, in 1812 its population was 12,032 inhabitants, being the
                second least populated in the Intendancy despite being the capital and being surpassed by Cajamarca,
                Chiclayo, Piura, among others. 4 This continued to hold throughout the ages until its exponential rise
                in the 20th century. </p>

            <p class="pcul">Within its territory inhabited various important cultures such as the Mochica and the Chim√∫,
                both developed before the Incas.
                The huacas of the Sun and of the Moon belong to the Moches, while the Chim√∫ culture was the one that
                built the citadel of Chan Chan, which corresponded to the capital of their kingdom. In 1534, Diego de
                Almagro founded the city, turning it into a corregimiento and administrative capital of the area.
                Important temples such as the Cathedral and other churches were built. The city achieved its
                independence in 1820, being the first in Peru to achieve its freedom from Spain. </p>

                temperature that varies between 14¬∞ and 30¬∞C due to the Humboldt current. Trujillo has a hot climate on
                summer days, and cool and pleasant at night due to the effect of the sea breeze. It has an annual
                average temperature of 18 ¬∞C, and the extreme minimum and maximum temperatures fluctuate around 23 ¬∞C
                and 31 ¬∞C in summer, respectively, with peaks of minimums of 26 ¬∞C and maximums of 33 ¬∞C. </p>
